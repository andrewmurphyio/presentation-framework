# Presentation Framework

A code-first presentation framework for creating professional conference talks with animations, design systems, and multiple audience variants. Built using AI-agent-driven development with the Ralph Wiggum methodology.

## What is This?

This project creates a presentation authoring system where slides are written in text-based formats and compiled to browser-based presentations. The framework separates content from presentation, supports version control, and enables creating multiple variants of a talk for different audiences without duplicating content.

**Key Features:**
- Design system with tokens, layouts, and reusable components
- Talk variants for different audiences (technical, executive, beginner, advanced)
- Animations and transitions with named presets
- Browser-based output with presenter view and speaker notes
- Variant-aware metadata optimized for CFP submissions
- Text-based authoring that diffs well in git

## Ralph Wiggum Methodology

This project is built using the **Ralph Wiggum (RW)** methodology - an AI-agent-driven workflow for autonomous software development through iteration.

### How It Works

**Phase 1: Define Requirements** (Conversational)
- Human and AI discuss the project interactively
- Identify Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)
- Create specification files in `specs/*.md` as understanding develops
- Each spec focuses on outcomes and acceptance criteria, not implementation

**Phase 2: Planning** (Automated Loop)
- Run `./loop.sh plan` to generate implementation plan
- AI agent analyzes specs and existing code
- Outputs prioritized task list in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

**Phase 3: Building** (Automated Loop)
- Run `./loop.sh` to start build iterations
- Agent picks highest priority task
- Implements, tests, commits, pushes
- Regenerates plan with fresh context, repeats

### Key Principles

- **Context is Everything** - Each loop iteration gets fresh context
- **Specs Define Outcomes** - Not implementation details
- **Let Ralph Ralph** - Trust the loop to self-correct
- **Steering via Backpressure** - Tests and lints reject bad work

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
- Git repository initialized
- Access to Claude Opus/Sonnet models

### Running the Loop

**Full Planning (on main branch):**
```bash
./loop.sh plan              # Generate full project plan
./loop.sh plan 5            # Limit to 5 iterations
```

**Scoped Planning (on work branches):**
```bash
git checkout -b ralph/design-system
./loop.sh plan-work "design system tokens and theming"
```

**Building:**
```bash
./loop.sh                   # Build with unlimited iterations
./loop.sh 20                # Build with max 20 iterations
```

### Workflow

1. **Define requirements** - Work conversationally with AI to create/refine specs
2. **Plan** - Run `./loop.sh plan` to generate implementation plan
3. **Create work branch** - `git checkout -b ralph/feature-name`
4. **Scoped planning** - `./loop.sh plan-work "feature description"`
5. **Build** - `./loop.sh` to execute the plan
6. **Create PR** - `gh pr create` when complete

### Stopping the Loop

- `Ctrl+C` - Stop the current loop
- `git reset --hard` - Revert uncommitted changes if needed

## Specifications

The `specs/` directory contains outcome-focused requirements:

- **slide-authoring.md** - Text-based slide format and structure
- **talk-metadata.md** - Metadata for talks, speakers, and CFP submissions
- **design-system.md** - Tokens, layouts, components, and visual consistency
- **animations.md** - Animation presets and build sequences
- **talk-variants.md** - Multi-audience support (technical, executive, etc.)
- **theming.md** - Visual themes and customization
- **media.md** - Images, videos, and embedded content
- **output-rendering.md** - Browser-based presentation output

Each spec describes:
- The job to be done
- Acceptance criteria
- Constraints and considerations
- NOT implementation details (those emerge during build)

## Development Status

This project is in active development using the Ralph Wiggum methodology. Check `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for current status and upcoming work.

## Git Strategy

Each loop iteration creates one commit. Work branches contain scoped plans for specific features. The workflow ensures Ralph (the AI agent) works within well-defined boundaries:

- **main** - Full project plan lives here
- **ralph/feature-name** - Work branches with scoped plans
- Each iteration: implement → test → commit → push
- Fresh context on every loop iteration
